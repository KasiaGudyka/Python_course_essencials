# Python_course_essencials
---------------------------
Repository for small programs inspired by tasks from course available on Codecademy on basics of Python.

Each program is upated to Python 3 and expanded with additional functions.

The course was focused on essencials of programming, however it gave me a good start to improve my Python knowledge via other online courses like Hackerrank and SoloLearn (completed in 100%, link https://www.sololearn.com/certificates/course/en/20858943/1073/landscape/png) 

Currently I am working on an educational application as a Python Back-end Developer (link: https://forum.kodujdlapolski.pl/t/aplikacja-edukacyjna-szukamy-back-end-front-end-developera/3923)
